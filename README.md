# My Bus Stops

I saw https://bustimes.org and liked it a lot.

I speculated about having a very simple bookmarked page that's a departures
board for my few nearest bus stops. So this is it.

It's a NextJS app, which I deploy on Vercel's free tier.

Until you configure, no stops will display. Click the config link for the
minimum viable config page.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
